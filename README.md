# Netflix Series Fixer 

This simple Browser Extension fixes 3 issues involving Series on Netflix:
1. When the toolbar Icon is clicked, converts a jbv-query to the Series' Home Page
2. Updates the Tab's Title to match the Series' Title
3. When watching an Episode, updates the Tab's Title to display the Episode Name and Series' Title

## Installation
See my installation guide for 3rd Party Extensions [here](https://adamantlife.github.io/browserextension.html).
